HACKING
-------

virtinst is tied closely with libvirt, so it's recommended to try and run
the latest libvirt code if using virtinst from an upstream checkout. See
http://libvirt.org/downloads.html

The following commands will be useful for anyone writing patches:

    python setup.py test      : Run local unit test suite
    python setup.py check     : Run a pylint script against the codebase
    python setup.py test_urls : Test our install media fetching infrastructure

Any patches shouldn't change the output of 'test' or 'check'. Our pylint
script uses a blacklist rather than a whitelist approach, so it could
throw some false positives or useless messages. If you think you're patch
exposes one of these, bring it up on the mailing list
(et-mgmt-tools@redhat.com).

'test_urls' only needs to be run if the patch is against the url fetching
code (virtinst/OSDistro.py, some pieces of virtinst/DistroManager). This
stuff is notoriously fragile, so running 'test_urls' is a must. If you
are debugging a certain url failure, you can use the --match option to
specify specific distros to test.

'test' and 'test_urls' have a --debug option if you are hitting problems.
